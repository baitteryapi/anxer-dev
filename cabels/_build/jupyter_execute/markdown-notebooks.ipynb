    "# CCCV Cycles in Battery Charging\n",
    "\n",
    "CCCV cycles, standing for Constant Current Constant Voltage cycles, are a widely used charging method, particularly in the context of lithium-ion batteries. This charging technique involves two main phases: a Constant Current (CC) phase followed by a Constant Voltage (CV) phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constant Current (CC) Phase:\n",
    "- In the initial stage of charging, a constant current is applied to the battery.\n",
    "- During this phase, the charging current remains constant, leading to a gradual increase in the voltage across the battery terminals.\n",
    "- The CC phase is effective for quickly charging the battery, especially when it has a low state of charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constant Voltage (CV) Phase:\n",
    "- Once the battery voltage reaches a predetermined level (often referred to as the \"voltage limit\" or \"absorption voltage\"), the charging system switches to the constant voltage phase.\n",
    "- During the CV phase, the voltage across the battery terminals is kept constant, and the charging current gradually decreases.\n",
    "- This phase is essential for preventing overcharging, as the voltage is limited to a safe level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CCCV Cycle Breakdown:\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - The charging process begins with the constant current phase, providing a steady and controlled current to the battery.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Transition to Constant Voltage:**\n",
    "   - Once the battery voltage approaches the desired level, the system transitions to the constant voltage phase to prevent overcharging.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Absorption:**\n",
    "   - During the constant voltage phase, the battery is in the absorption state, absorbing the remaining charge while the voltage is held constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Termination:**\n",
    "   - Charging is terminated when the charging current falls below a certain threshold, indicating that the battery is fully charged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CCCV charging method is widely used due to its efficiency and controlled charging, maximizing both speed and safety.\n",
